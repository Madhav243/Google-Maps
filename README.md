# Google-Maps

This is my first Project in Pyhton Programming that is using Sqlite3 database management System.

In this i am using Dr Chucks API for Google data as there is no limit on this API.
In this project there is two different type of program for asking user input.
One is googlemap.py which use gui for asking location and mark that location on google map in web browser and Another is geoload.py which use command prompt for input.
In geoload.py we can add multiple locations to mark in map whereas in googlemap.py we can only see 1 location at one time.

You should install the SQLite browser to view and modify
the databases from:

http://sqlitebrowser.org/
